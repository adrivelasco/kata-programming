## Tech Stack

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

## Notes

- The algorithm to resolve the combination of attacks given a list of potions is in the file:`s rc/algorithm/getTheMostDamagingAttacks.ts`
- All the logic is isolated in a custom hook, `usePotionCalculator.ts` and used in the `PotionCalculator` component
- I wrote unit tests to cover the algorithm functionality and the redux store
- It's mobile responsive
